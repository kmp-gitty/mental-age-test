          Our Mental Age Test
        </a>{' '}
        takes you through a series of 17 binary choice questions. That is, only 1 of 2 answers can be selected.<br /><br />

        The aims of the test are to assess your attitudes, preferences, behaviors, empathy, social awareness & thinking strategy. The simple "this or that" answer choices allows you to calm your mind and simplify the thinking process to truly discover what your unbiased thoughts regarding each topic is.<br /><br />

        Each question is correlated to a specific topic above, answers are considered individually, combined by each topic cluster and then assessed by the overall total to estimate your mental age.<br />
        Another blog post will deep dive into each topic cluster.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Attitudes, Preferences and Behaviors</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
      Your Mental Age is a reflection of what you think and feel across many situations you encounter, as well as what you think and feel across many individuals you encounter.<br /><br />

      Attitudes: Are you generally optimistic or pessimistic? Glass half full or half empty? See the general good in people or have a general wariness about others?<br /><br />

      Preferences: With others or alone? Strong opinion or go with the flow?<br /><br />

      Behaviors: How in control are you? Do you wear your heart on your sleeve? What would you do in certain situations?<br /><br />
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Empathy, Social Awareness and Thinking Strategy</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
      Beyond the three topics above, what else goes into calculating your Mental Age?
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
      Empathy: Do you think about others? Can you feel for others? Can you walk a mile in someone's shoes?
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
      Social Awareness: How much space do you take up? Are you considerate of others? Do you give unprompted help?
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
      Thinking Strategy:

        noted that cognitive associations are beyond the definition of personality. However, for your Mental Age, an element of this is needed to round out the determination. How well do you think on your feet? How do you tackle a problem? Is your mind flexible?
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">How Best to Take the Test</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
      Like any test you've had across your schooling, it's always recommended to take this in a quiet environment that is free from outside distraction. The goal is to assess you without any external worries or factors, to get a true sense of how you think, feel and react.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
      It's important to be honest, answering questions truthfully is the best way to get an accurate assessment. Stay focused, the quiet environment will help, but this also means channeling your thoughts only to the question at-hand - no outside or inside noise. Lastly, reflect (just not for too long). Consider your typical behaviors, there will always bee outlier events and actions, but this test is about the everyday you.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
      Remember, this test is for fun. To see a side of you that you may not have realized or to affirm a suspicion you had about yourself. What this test is not, is a final judgement of you or your mind.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
      Overall it's an attempt to provide insight into how your cognitive and emotional maturity compares to your chronological age.<br /><br />
