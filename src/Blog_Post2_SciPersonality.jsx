          The American Psychological Association
        </a>{' '}
        defines Personality as: "The enduring configuration of characteristics and behavior that comprises an individual's unique adjustment to life, including major traits, interests, drives, values, self-concept, abilities, and emotional patterns."<br /><br />

        Put plainly — Personality refers to the patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviors that distinguishes you from other people. It encompasses how you interact with your environment, people around you and within yourself. It's part internal and part external.<br /><br />

        Internal: how you personally think and feel, what your general outlook on happenings in the world are and what you choose to take interests in.<br />
        External: how you filter your internal feelings into external actions toward a person, thing, situation or how you spend your time.

          The APA
        </a>'s definition says "enduring", so does that mean my personality cannot change? Absolutely not.<br /><br />

        Personality is not fixed and can evolve over time.{' '}

          A study
        </a>{' '}
        conducted at UC, Berkeley (published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology), found that over time as we age personality demonstrably changes.<br /><br />

        The study looked at the "big five" traits of personality: Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, Openness and Extraversion. The study found that after age 30, we normally see personality changes within individuals — for the better!"
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">How Does Personality Change?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The study mentioned above looked at over 130,000 adults, ages 21–60, and charted trends in the "big five" traits over life spans.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        They found changes amongst the traits change differently over time:
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        - Conscientiousness: increased throughout age ranges with largest change happening in your 20s<br />
        - Agreeableness: continued to increase from 30–60<br />
        - Neuroticism: decreased with age, past young adulthood<br />
        - Openness: surprisingly decreased slightly over time, but most likely due to the lack of desire to form new relationships<br />
        - Extraversion: varied, but mostly in-line with openness as people tend to want to stick to the relationships they have as they age<br />
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Personality and Mental Age</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Elements of Mental Age and Personality are intertwined. Your personality mainly has to do with maturity and emotional intelligence (similar to mental age), the difference is your cognitive flexibility.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        Mental Age includes Openness, Emotional Intelligence and Self-Awareness — which align with the "big five" personality traits. However, your strategic thinking, problem solving and memory don't exactly align with personality, but can influence how you see and react to the world around you.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Your personality can be thought of in 5 traits. These traits usually change over time and so does your personality. As we age we normally become more thoughtful, emotionally mature and think of others — but may not be looking to make new friends our whole life.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Personality and mental age share similarities and learning one can inform the other.<br /><br />
